\chapter{Background}\label{background}
This chapter provides an overview of the background knowledge necessary to understand the project.

\Cref{background:proof-systems} presents three proof systems: natural deduction, the $\lambda$-calculus, and the Sequent Calculus \textsc{lk}. The algorithms presented in the subsequent chapters are primarily tested on variations of these three systems. \Cref{background:comparison} evaluates numerous logic learning tools. \Cref{background:parsing} explains why the \lstinline{parjs} library is chosen for the parsing tasks in this project and presents features of \lstinline{parjs} that guide certain algorithm design decisions.
