\chapter{Background}\label{background}
This chapter provides an overview of various examples of proof systems, the \lstinline{parjs} parsing library, and a comparison of existing educational proof assistants. \Cref{background:proof-systems} presents three proof systems: Natural Deduction, the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus, and the Sequent Calculus \textsc{lk}. They are chosen because the algorithms presented in \Cref{chapter:input} and \Cref{chapter:checking} are primarily tested on variations of these three systems. \Cref{background:parsing} explains why the \lstinline{parjs} library is chosen for the parsing tasks in this project and presents features of \lstinline{parjs} that guide certain algorithm design decisions. Finally, \Cref{background:comparison} evaluates numerous logic learning tools based on user experience and flexibility to support numerous proof systems, then summarises common features that guide the development of the application.
