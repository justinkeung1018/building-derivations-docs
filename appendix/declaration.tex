\section*{Use of generative AI}
I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT 4.0 (OpenAI, \url{https://chatgpt.com/}) and Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic, \url{https://claude.ai}) for finding background information, debugging, and checking whether certain implementation decisions adhere to best practices. I confirm that no content generated by AI has been presented as my own work.

\section*{Ethical considerations}
There are no ethical issues associated with this project.

\section*{Sustainability}
The web application is hosted on Vercel \cite{vercel}. It is run on a serverless architecture, which is only run on-demand and, therefore, more energy-efficient than traditional servers, which run all the time even when there are no pending jobs \cite{vercel-green}.
\section*{Availability of data and materials}
The source code is available as a public repository via \url{https://github.com/justinkeung1018/building-derivations}. The web application is currently available via \url{https://building-derivations.vercel.app}, but this may change in the future. The GitHub repository will contain the updated link.
